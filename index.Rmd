I am Ambizione Postdoctoral Fellow at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of EPFL. Before moving to the LASTRO in April 2017, I was a Postodoctoral Associate at the Astrophysics Reaserch Institute (LJMU, UK) and at the Bologna OBservatory (IT).
I received my Ph.D. in astronomy titled ["Multiple stellar populations in globular clusters with photometry and low resolution spectroscopy"](http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/5204/) in 2013 from the University of Bologna (IT).





My research interests lie in the broad field stellar populations. I worked on a variety of science topics in this field and in particular on the following research areas: 





I am also contributing to large community programs, in particular the [Gaia-ESO survey](https://www.gaia-eso.eu) (PIs: G. Gimore and S. Randich), for which I was given the "Survey Builder" status, and the PRISTINE (PIs: E. Starkenburg and N. Martin) consortium.
