Stellar populations contain a wealth of information on the formation and evolution of galaxies. We are able to trace the evolution of galaxies back to their formation by measuring chemical abundances of individual stars and integrated light from unresolved stellar clusters. To understand how galaxies formed and evolve I followed different yet complementary lines of investigation using different tools (photometry, high- and low-resolution spectroscopy in the optical and near-infrared of resolved and unresolved stellar populations).

I worked on a variety of science topics in the broad field of stellar populations and in particular on the following research areas:

1. The observational study of the chemical anomalies in globular clusters (GCs) through spec- troscopy and photometry.
2. The investigation of the chemical properties of the most-metal poor stars in the Milky Way.
3. The study the major components of our own Galaxy using high-quality spectroscopic observations.
4. The determination of quantitative (i.e. from absorption lines) abundances in external galaxies from near-infrared (IR) spectroscopy of individual stars and/or unresolved star clusters.


I am Ambizione Postdoctoral Fellow at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of EPFL. Before moving to the LASTRO in April 2017, I was a Postodoctoral Associate at the Astrophysics Reaserch Institute (LJMU, UK) and at the Bologna OBservatory (IT).
I received my Ph.D. in astronomy titled ["Multiple stellar populations in globular clusters with photometry and low resolution spectroscopy"](http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/5204/) in 2013 from the University of Bologna (IT).




I am also contributing to large community programs, in particular the [Gaia-ESO survey](https://www.gaia-eso.eu) (PIs: G. Gimore and S. Randich), for which I was given the "Survey Builder" status, and the PRISTINE (PIs: E. Starkenburg and N. Martin) consortium.
