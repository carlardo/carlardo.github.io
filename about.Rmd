#### The Enigma of the Multiple Populations in Stellar Clusters

<img src="images/antennae.pdf" style="width:50%;  margin-right: 20px" align="left">

Globular clusters (GCs) have seen the earliest phases of galaxy formation and evolution. Thus they represent a fossil record of the formation history of the host system. The discovery that GCs do not fit within the traditional picture of being composed by stars with the same age and chemical abundances within some small tolerance has led to a growing interest in cluster studies. GCs host multiple populations (MPs) of stars with spreads in He and many other light elements (namely C, N, O, Na, Al, Mg). Several formation scenarios have been proposed to explain the chemical MPs, but none of them is able to entirely reproduce observations.
The origin of this phenomenon is arguably the largest open question within the GC community at present and it is unlikely that most of the questions about GC formation and evolution will be answered without a new insight on MPs. 


**A critical discussion of the state-of-the-art of the MP studies can be found in the review ["Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters"](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ARA%26A..56...83B) that appeared in Volume 56 of Annual Reviews of Astronomy & Astrophysics (Bastian and Lardo, 2018).**


#### Near-field cosmology with extremely metal-poor stars

Long-lived extremely metal-poor (EMP, with [Fe/H]≤ –3) stars in the Local Group offer the unique opportunity to investigate the initial stages of the cosmic history in great detail. 
Given that the early Universe was devoid of metals, their very low metallicity means they are extremely old. Thus, they represent reachable probes of first stages of the enrichment of the primordial Universe, complementing direct studies of high-redshift galaxies.

In a typical high latitude field, only one in ∼ 80, 000 stars has [Fe/H]≤ -4 dex (Youakim et al., 2017) and less than 20 stars with [Fe/H] ≤ – 4.5 dex are known (Christlieb et al., 2002; Frebel et al., 2005; Caffau et al., 2011; Keller et al., 2014; Bonifacio et al., 2015; Aguado et al., 2018a,b).
The photometric survey Pristin is especially designed to identify EMPs in a efficient way (Starkenburg et al., 2017). Pristine builds on the combination of the CaH&K filter and the wide field of MegaCam at CFHT, to cover a large footprint and yield a pre-selection of EMPs that is ∼5 times better than previous surveys. Low- and high-resolution spectro- scopic follow-ups of selected metal-poor stars are on-going to accomplish the full potential of Pristine. On low-resolution spectrographs, large numbers of stars can be quickly surveyed and Fe and C abundances measured. The most promising candidates with [Fe/H] < –3 are selected to be observed with high-resolution spectrographs to study their detailed abundance patterns. 

**Pristine has already started to deliver outstanding results with the discovery of a very special object, Pristine 221.8781+9.7844 (Starkenburg et al., 2018). This object is among the ten most metal-poor stars known and it is one out of two outstanding stars that do not show carbon enhancement (the other is SDSS J102915+172927; see Caffau et al. 2011).**
